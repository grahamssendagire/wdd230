    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
        Your local chamber of commerce isnot a government agency. That means it likely doesnot receive any money from the government. 
        Chambers of commerce are often operated as nonprofit organizations, which means they arenot trying to make a profit. Instead, 
        they aim to make just enough money to support their activities..</p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
        The business members benefit the most from a chamber of commerce, but the community as a whole can also benefit.
         By supporting local businesses and helping them grow, the organization gives community members access to more shopping and services.
         It can help the area thrive and make it easier for consumers to find what they need.
